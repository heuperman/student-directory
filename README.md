# student-directory #

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at BÃ©la Fleck's Banjo Academy.
Students can be added to the list and recalled by their cohort.
The list can be loaded from and saved to an external file.

## How to use ##

```shell
ruby directory.rb('filename')
```

If no filename is given, this app will use students.csv per default.
